            <p>This is the next step to becoming a C|EH¬Æ Master after you have achieved your C|EH¬Æ
              certification. Within the C|EH¬Æ Practical, you have limited time to complete 20 challenges
              to test your skills and proficiency in a performance-based cyber range. This exam is NOT a
              simulation and incorporates a live corporate network of VMs and applications with solutions
              to uncover vulnerabilities.

            The C|EH¬Æ v12 program helps you develop real-world experience in ethical hacking through
            the hands-on C|EH¬Æ practice environment. The C|EH¬Æ Engage equips you with the skills to
            prove that you have what it takes to be a great ethical hacker.<br /><br />
            New to C|EH¬Æ v12, students will embark on their first emulated ethical hacking engagement.
            This 4-phase engagement requires students to think critically and test the knowledge and
            skills gained by capturing a series of flags in each phase, demonstrating the live application of
            skills and abilities in a consequence-free environment through EC-Council‚Äôs new Cyber Range.<br /><br />
            As you complete your training and hands-on labs, the C|EH¬Æ Engage lets you apply everything
            you have learned in a mock ethical hacking engagement. This 4-part security engagement gives
            you a real ethical hacking engagement experience from start to finish against an emulated
            organization. Using our capture-the-flag-style range, you will complete your engagement by
            answering ‚Äúflag‚Äù questions as you progress.
          </p>
          <h2>Your Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Whether this is your first engagement or you‚Äôre honing your skills, get ready to test your ethical
            hacking knowledge like never before! Once you‚Äôve practiced through the hands-on guided
            labs, it‚Äôs time to apply your knowledge, take on the hacker persona, and find the vulnerabilities
            and weaknesses in ABCDorg‚Äîall built in our C|EH¬Æ Engage (practice range).
